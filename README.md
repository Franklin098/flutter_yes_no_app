# flutter_yes_no_app

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Install Provider Package

- [Provider Package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider/install)

The provider package works similar as in React, you can choose where to add a provider inside the widget tree. All the child widgets will have access to the provider (not the parent or siblings).
